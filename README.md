# All About Me!

Hello there, I'm Zylly. I make Geometry Dash texture stuff and also create levels too (1.9 ones to be specific but sometmes I make 2.1 layouts for fun).

I am trying to learn web development and I just got back to HTML and CSS, and I am learning a bit of Python too. Feel free to look at my repositories if you would like to.
