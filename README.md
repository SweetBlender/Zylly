# All About Me!
Hi, I'm Zylly. I make Geometry Dash texture stuff and also create levels too (1.9 ones to be specific but sometmes I make 2.1 layouts for fun).

I am trying to learn web development and I just got back to HTML and CSS, and I am learning a bit of Python too. Feel free to look at my repositories and give some feedback so I can improve a lot more, that would really mean a lot to me.

# Other Stuff (You Can Also Contact Me)
- My Twitter is @Zylsia.
- My Discord is Aroo#1590, though that is probably going to change to Zylly pretty soon. Once that happens I'll definitely update this part.
